/// <summary>
/// Accepts a pending booking request on behalf of the authenticated Hall Owner
/// (US-OWNER-11, FR-BOOK-01). The owner is resolved from the JWT session; ownership
/// is enforced by comparing the session user id to the persisted hall owner id so a
/// caller can never accept another owner's booking. Acceptance transitions the booking
/// from Pending to Accepted (deposit-pending in this model). The requested period(s)
/// remain protected (reserved); the period is NOT permanently marked as Booked because
/// the deposit workflow (US-BOOK-05) is not yet implemented.
///
/// The accept-vs-cancel race is resolved at the database level via an atomic conditional
/// UPDATE (AcceptPendingAsync / CancelPendingAsync): exactly one wins per row. A lost
/// race surfaces as a ConflictException so the caller knows the request was already
/// processed.
