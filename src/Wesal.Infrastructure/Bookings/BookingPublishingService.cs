/// <summary>
/// Publishes an accepted booking's booked period as Booked on behalf of the
/// authenticated Hall Owner (US-OWNER-13, FR-BOOK-06). The owner is resolved from
/// the JWT session; ownership is enforced by comparing the session user id to the
/// persisted hall owner id so a caller can never publish another owner's booking.
///
/// Publishing is only valid for a booking that is Accepted and not yet published.
/// Before the atomic publish, a mandatory final server-side availability re-check
/// rejects the request when any other active (Pending or Accepted) booking claims
/// the exact same hall/date/period, and the exact HallAvailability period is
/// reserved as Booked so the published period is definitively excluded from public
/// availability. Only the booking's own requested period is ever touched.
///
/// The publish-vs-publish (and publish-vs-state-change) race is resolved at the
/// database level via an atomic conditional UPDATE (PublishAcceptedAsync): exactly
/// one wins per row, and a lost race surfaces as a ConflictException. The whole
/// operation runs inside a single database transaction so a failure never leaves
/// partial state (published booking with a released period, or vice versa).
