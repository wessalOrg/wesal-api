/// <summary>
/// Permanently deletes a booking on behalf of the authenticated Hall Owner
/// (US-OWNER-15). The owner is resolved from the JWT session; ownership is enforced
/// by comparing the session user id to the persisted hall owner id so a caller can
/// never delete another owner's booking (or a booking of another owner's hall).
///
/// Deletion is a terminal, hard delete: the booking row is removed and its exact
/// requested HallAvailability period is released to Available when no other active
/// (Pending or Accepted) booking claims the same hall/date/period. Releasing the
/// exact period also clears the public 'Booked' status of a published booking, so
/// public availability queries no longer report the period as Booked. No other
/// period, date, booking, conversation, or message is ever touched: conversations
/// are scoped to a hall and user (not to a booking), so deleting a booking cannot
/// orphan or break a conversation, and delivered rejection messages remain as
/// conversation history. Deleting a rejected/undelivered booking simply removes the
/// only source a deferred rejection notification is derived from, which prevents a
/// stale pending-booking notification.
///
/// The delete-vs-delete (and delete-vs-state-change) race is resolved at the
/// database level via an atomic conditional DELETE (DeleteAsync): exactly one
/// deletion wins per row, and a lost race surfaces as a ConflictException. The
/// whole operation runs inside a single database transaction so a failure never
/// leaves partial state (a deleted booking with a still-Booked period, or a
/// released period with no booking to justify it).
